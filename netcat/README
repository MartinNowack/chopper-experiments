In this benchmark, there is a bug at line netcat.c:1364.
The error occurs when read() at line 1357 returns -1, and then passed to memcpy at line 1364.

In this example I want to skip the call for res_init() at line 1319 and EVERYTHING after the line 1389.
At this point I can't do the latter, because we skip stuff on the function level.

Once I am able to do it, I can run something like:
klee -libc=uclibc --posix-runtime -skip-functions=res_init test.bc --sym-args 0 2 4 --sym-stdin 10 --fd-fail
